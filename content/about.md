Looking around at the world today in both everyday observations and also more in depth analysis of critical issues, I usually see brokenness. The brokenness can be anything from a poorly designed door to a broken process intentionally designed to restrict freedom. Either way, I'm fed up with it. There is too much to fix and too much to build for any one person to do it all. I'm collecting my observations, analysis and findings of what is currently being done on certain issues in the hope that others will pick up parts of this fight.
